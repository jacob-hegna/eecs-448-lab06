Buglist:
 - isEmpty always returns true
 - addBack adds things to the front of the list (the bug is that it adds things in the wrong order)
 - removeBack doesn't remove elements from the list
 - removeFront doesn't remove elements frm the list

Side effects
 - It could be that removeBack and removeFront work, but they don't do anything because isEmpty always returns true
 - size returns values that are too large sometimes, but that is because removeBack and removeFront don't remove items from the list
